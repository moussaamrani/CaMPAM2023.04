\section{Suggesting Changes In View(s Types)}
\label{sec:Suggestion}

Figure \ref{fig:Suggestion} depicts a \metamodel that capture the
required elements for helping methodologists improve their designs.
On the following, we assume that a methodologist is working on a \metamodel
under evolution \textsf{MM}, that is linked to a family $\mathsf{VT}$ of viewtypes
(i.e. $\mathsf{VT} = (\mathsf{VT}_\mathsf{i})_{\mathsf{i}\in [1..n]}$). Note that in the discussion above, when we discuss
\textsf{MM}'s (meta-)elements, we consider \textsf{MM} as a \emph{model}
conforming to a particular meta-\metamodel (such as \textsc{Mof} \cite{TR:OMG-MOF:2016}):
we therefore discuss changes on \textsf{MM}'s packages, classes (e.g. 
\textsf{FSM} or \textsf{State} in our example) and their structural features
(such as the attribute \textsf{name} or the reference \textsf{src}).

A \textsf{Suggestion} is the core element of our approach, and contains three 
parts: a \textsf{Change}, some \textsf{Relation}s, and a list of 
\textsf{Recommendation}s. 
%
As detailed in Figure \ref{fig:Change}, a \textsf{Change} captures the nature of
alterations operated on \textsf{MM}'s meta-elements. 
A \textsf{Relation} provides tracebility links between \textsf{MM} and \textsf{VT}:
for each meta-element in \textsf{MM} subject to a \textsf{Change}, a \textsf{Relation}
identifies which meta-elements in \textsf{VT} may be affected. 
Finally, a \textsf{Recommendation} details possible actions a methodologist may 
perform to realign \textsf{VT} after the \textsf{Change}. 
Note that a \textsf{Suggestion} may 
associate \emph{no} \textsf{Recommendation}s, in case a \textsf{Change} has no
impact on \viewtypes; or \emph{several} \textsf{Recommendation}s for the same 
\textsf{Change}, depending on the complexity of the \textsf{Change}, and how 
many \viewtypes are concerned by the \textsf{Change}.

The rest of this Section details each part in a \textsf{Suggestion}; a summary
is presented in Table \ref{tab:suggestions}.
