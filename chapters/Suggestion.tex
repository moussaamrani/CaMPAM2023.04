\section{Suggesting Changes In View(s Types)}
\label{sec:Suggestion}

\LC{Here, MM is linked to multiple VTs; this complicates matters, particularly regarding the 'several recommendations' below. Why not consider Suggestion as pertaining to one VT only, and thus, a MM change may be associated with multiple Suggestions, one per VT concerned.}

Figure \ref{fig:Suggestion} depicts a \metamodel that captures the
required elements for helping methodologists improve their designs.
In the following, we assume that a methodologist is working on a \metamodel
under evolution \textsf{MM}, that is linked to a set $\mathsf{VT}$ of viewtypes
(i.e. $\mathsf{VT} = (\mathsf{VT}_\mathsf{i})_{\mathsf{i}\in [1..n]}$). Note that in the discussion above, when we discuss
\textsf{MM}'s (meta-)elements, we consider \textsf{MM} as a \emph{model}
conforming to a particular meta-\metamodel (such as \textsc{Mof} \cite{TR:OMG-MOF:2016}):
we therefore discuss changes on \textsf{MM}'s packages, classes (e.g. 
\textsf{FSM} or \textsf{State} in our example) and their structural features
(such as the attribute \textsf{name} or the reference \textsf{src}).

A \textsf{Suggestion} is the core element of our approach, and contains three 
parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A \textsf{Change}, detailed in Figure \ref{fig:Change}, capturing the nature of
alterations operated on \textsf{MM}'s meta-elements; 
    \item A \textsf{Relation}, providing traceability links between \textsf{MM} and \textsf{VT}: for each meta-element in \textsf{MM} subject to a \textsf{Change}, a \textsf{Relation}
identifies which meta-elements in \textsf{VT} may be affected;
    \item A \textsf{Recommendation}, detailing possible actions a methodologist may perform to realign \textsf{VT} after the \textsf{Change}. 
\end{enumerate}

Note that a \textsf{Suggestion} may 
associate \emph{no} \textsf{Recommendation}s, in case a \textsf{Change} has no
impact on \viewtypes; or \emph{several} \textsf{Recommendation}s for the same 
\textsf{Change}, depending on the complexity of the \textsf{Change}, and how 
many \viewtypes are concerned by the \textsf{Change}.

The rest of this Section details each part in a \textsf{Suggestion}; a summary
is presented in Table \ref{tab:suggestions}.
