\section{Suggesting Changes In View(s Types)}
\label{sec:Suggestion}

Figure \ref{fig:Suggestion} depicts a \metamodel that captures the
required elements for helping methodologists improve their \viewtype designs,
by suggesting possible ways to reflect evolution changes inside \viewtypes.
In the following, we assume that a methodologist is working on a \metamodel
under evolution \textsf{MM}, that is linked to a set $\mathsf{VT}$ of viewtypes
(i.e. $\mathsf{VT} = (\mathsf{VT}_\mathsf{i})_{\mathsf{i}\in [1..n]}$). Note that in the discussion above, when we discuss
\textsf{MM}'s (meta-)elements, we consider \textsf{MM} as a \emph{model}
conforming to a particular meta-\metamodel (such as \textsc{Mof} \cite{TR:OMG-MOF:2016}):
we therefore discuss changes on \textsf{MM}'s packages, classes (e.g. 
\textsf{FSM} or \textsf{State} in our example) and their structural features
(such as the attribute \textsf{name} or the reference \textsf{src}).

A \textsf{Suggestion} is the core element of our approach, and contains three 
parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A change \textsf{Operator}, detailed in Figure \ref{fig:Operator}, capturing the nature of
alterations operated on \textsf{MM}'s meta-elements; 
    \item A \textsf{Relation}, providing traceability links between \textsf{MM} 
		and \textsf{VT}: for each meta-element in \textsf{MM} subject to a 
		change by an \textsf{Operator}, a \textsf{Relation} identifies which 
		meta-elements in \textsf{VT} may be affected;
    \item A \textsf{Recommendation}, detailing possible actions a methodologist 
		may perform to realign \textsf{VT} after a change. 
		\item Some \textsf{Condition}s providing additional informations on the
		applicability of \textsf{Operator}s, as well as domain-specific knowledge.
		\MA{For now, I still don't see where these would be helpful in our example.
		We may still discuss that in general in the Discussion Section, but in that
		case, we should remove it from the \textsf{Suggestion} metamodel!}
\end{enumerate}

Note that a \textsf{Suggestion} may 
associate \emph{no} \textsf{Recommendation}s, in case an \textsf{Operator} has no
impact on \viewtypes; or \emph{several} \textsf{Recommendation}s for the same 
\textsf{Operator}, depending on the \textsf{Operator}'s complexity, and how 
many \viewtypes are concerned by the \textsf{Operator}.

The rest of this Section details each part in a \textsf{Suggestion}; a summary
is presented in Table \ref{tab:suggestions}.
