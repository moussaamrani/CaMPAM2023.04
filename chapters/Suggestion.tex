\section{Suggesting Changes In View(s Types)}
\label{sec:Suggestion}

Figure \ref{fig:Suggestion} depicts a \metamodel that capture the
required elements for helping methodologists improve their designs.
On the following, we assume that a methodologist is evolving a \metamodel
\textsf{MM} that is linked to a family of viewtypes $(\mathsf{VT}_i)$ 
(with $i\in [1..n]$). Note that in the discussion above, when we discuss
\textsf{MM}'s (meta-)elements, we consider \textsf{MM} as a \emph{model}
conforming to a particular meta-\metamodel (such as \textsc{Mof} \ref{}):
we therefore discuss changes on \textsf{MM}'s packages, classes (e.g. 
\textsf{FSM} or \textsf{State} in our example) and their structural features
(such as the attribute \textsf{name} or the reference \textsf{src}).

A \textsf{Suggestion} is the core element of our approach, and contains three 
parts: a \textsf{Change}, some \textsf{Relation}s, and a list of 
\textsf{Recommendation}s. 
%
As detailed in Figure \ref{fig:Change}, a \textsf{Change} captures the nature of
alterations operated on \textsf{MM}'s meta-elements. A \textsf{Change} refers 
to an \textsf{Operator} that may be parameterised with extra data, and contains 
contextual information (in \textsf{ApplicationPattern}). 
Change \textsf{Operator}s may target \emph{any} instanciable metamodel element, 
thus referring to the class \textsf{NamedElement} in \textsc{Mof}. Note that we 
will distinguish between \emph{primitive} and \emph{complex} \textsf{Operator}s,
depending on the number of such \metamodel elements an \textsf{Operator} acts on.

\textsf{Relation}s contain traceability links between \textsf{MM}'s and \viewtypes'
meta-elements. Note that these links may target \emph{several} meta-elements on 
the same \viewtype $\mathsf{VT_i}$, but also on \emph{various} \viewtypes. 

A \textsf{Recommendation} captures possible actions a methodologist may perform
to realign a \viewtype after a change. Note that a \textsf{Suggestion} may 
associate \emph{no} \textsf{Recommendation}s, in case a \textsf{Change} has no
impact on \viewtypes; or \emph{several} \textsf{Recommendation}s for the same 
\textsf{Change}, depending on the complexity of the \textsf{Change}, and how 
many \viewtypes are concerned by the \textsf{Change}.

The rest of this Section details each part in a \textsf{Suggestion}; a summary
is presented in Table \ref{tab:suggestions}.
