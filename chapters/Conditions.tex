\TW{The constraints are defined on either the \metamodel, its instance, the view generation operators or the target \viewtype \metamodel. Constraints may also form a hierarchy for the refinement of suggestions. The $SUC$ is either a textual description of the suggestion or a formalisation of possible changes or a change on the \viewtype \metamodel or a combination of all three. Either the textual description or the formalisation and the possible changes are preferable as it enables the methodologist to precisely define the change on the \viewtype \metamodel as well as giving some rationale. The formalization represents the middle way between the directly applicable definition of the changes and the textual description.}
