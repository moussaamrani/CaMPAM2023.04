discuss work, limitations, where it should go

viewtype transformations

more complex patterns to give better suggestions?

\textbf{Limitations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item we do not support \metamodel \metamodel co-evolution [weâ€™re looking at view-based only, not necessarily V-SUM, so MM-MM co-evolution not a concern]
    \item we do not support \metamodel model co-evolution
    \item \st{we only support co-evolution from the metamodel to the viewtype (which is actually not a limitation, since conceptually one can still start at the viewtype)}
    \item \st{we only support one metamodel as the source of a viewtype}
\end{itemize}
