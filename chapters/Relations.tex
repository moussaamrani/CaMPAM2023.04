\subsection{Relations}
\label{sec:Suggestion:Relation}

The \textsf{Relation} part provides traceability links between \textsf{MM}
elements that are \textsf{changed}, and all \viewtype elements that are 
\textsf{impacted} by that \textsf{Change}. One \textsf{MM} element
may impact several elements in the same \viewtype, but may also potentially
impact several \viewtypes. We only require so-called \emph{links}, but richer
data structures for traceability may be used \autocite{Batot-Cabot-Gerard:2021}.

The way these traceability links are computed are left as implementation
details, and may happen in two ways: \textsf{on-the-fly} imposes to create
those links every time an \textsf{MM} element is evolved; and \emph{offline}
allows for a complete evolution session to termine before triggering the
computation (based on diffing \autocite{Kehrer-Kelter-Taentzer:2011}, or using 
operation-based approaches \parencite{J:Lippe-Oosterom:1992}).

For our \textsf{FSM} example associated to the \viewtypes of Figure \ref{fig:VT},
we would have, among others, the following relations (with \textsf{Link}s noted 
as $\mathsf{<} \mathsf{changed} ; \mathsf{impacted} \mathsf{>}$):
\begin{itemize}
	\item For Step 1, we would only have one \textsf{Link} 
	$\mathsf{<} \mathsf{??} ; \mathsf{TextArea} \mathsf{>}$ in \textsf{Canva}, 
	since the latter is the only class impacted by the \textsf{PushProperty}. We would
	have two \textsf{Link}s in \textsf{TxtFSM}: 
	
	\item For Step 2, we would have in \textsf{Canva} two \textsf{Link}s: 
	$\mathsf{<} \mathsf{Transition} ; \mathsf{Arrow} \mathsf{>}$ and
	$\mathsf{<} \mathsf{Transition} ; \mathsf{TextArea} \mathsf{>}$. Similarly, ...
	
	\item The \textsf{Link}s produced for Step 3 would be same as the ones
	from Step 2.
