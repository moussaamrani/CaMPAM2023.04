\section{Approach} \label{sec:Approach}
For the \metamodel-\viewtype co-evolution we identified 34 operators from the change catalogue proposed by \cite{herrmannsdoerfer_extensive_2011}, which contains 27 \textit{primitive} and 34 \textit{complex} operators. Our work addresses all of the primitive and 7 complex operators. We choose the complex operators based on the work of \cite{khelladi_detecting_2015} who claims that these changes constitute 72\% of all complex changes during the evolution of GMF. \Cref{tab:suggestions} summarises the operators, their types, corresponding suggestions, and severity of applying these operators in the context of view-based development. We divided the chosen operators into three severity categories: major, minor, and ignore. When applied to a \metamodel, the operators in the latter category have no effect on the corresponding \viewtypes. The operators that can break the relationship between the evolving \metamodel and the corresponding \viewtypes are categorised as major. We classify the rest of the operators as minor since they are not breaking and has the potential of enriching the \viewtypes with additional information.

Among the primitive operations the creation of various entities are of minor severity as they do not influence the existing relation between the \metamodel and corresponding \viewtypes. For the creation of package, class, data type, and enumeration, we only notify the modeller about the addition of these entities. According to the \metamodeling formalism proposed by \cite{herrmannsdoerfer_extensive_2011}, attributes, literals, and references has composition relation with classes and enumerations. Therefore, in the event of the creation of these entities, we first identify the \viewtypes that reference the corresponding container (i.e., enumeration, class) and suggest the addition of the new entities for these \viewtypes.

The deletion of a package is possible iff it is empty and therefore, this operation can be safely ignored.
