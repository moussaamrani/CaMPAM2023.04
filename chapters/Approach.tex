\section{Suggestions for \viewtype co-evolution} 
\label{sec:Approach}

%\MA{I changed the Section's title from ``Approach'', which IMO does not fit anymore. Feel free though to improve that!}\LC{New title doesn't quite fit, viz.~title of preceding section. Perhaps we change preceding section's title to 'Conceptual Model for Viewtype Co-Evolution'?}

While the \textsf{Suggestion} \metamodel captures how we
conceptualise recommendations for co-evolving \viewtypes, we detail
in this section \textsf{Suggestion}'s ``content'', i.e. which exact \textsf{Recommendation}s
will be issued for each change \textsf{Operator} detected in an evolution
session. This results in Table~\ref{tab:suggestions}, where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Column \textsl{Operator} lists all \textsf{Operator}s considered in Figure~\ref{fig:Operator}. 
    However, the following \textsf{Operator}s, which are
	associated with severity \textsf{IGNORE}, are excluded from our Table, since 
	they do not result in any \textsf{Recommendation}: atomic operators \textit{Delete Package}, 
	\textit{Make/Drop Class Abstract}, \textit{Make/Drop Attribute Identifier}, 
	\textit{Make/Switch Reference Composite}, \textit{Make/Switch Reference Opposite}
	and complex operator \textit{Pull Property}. In other words, Table~\ref{tab:suggestions} only
	lists \textsf{Operator}s resulting in actual \textsf{Recommendation}, but all
	others simply do not issue any and thus, correspond to the \textsf{0} multiplicity
	in $\mathsf{Suggestion} \squaredots \mathsf{recommendations}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:Suggestion}.
	
	\item The \textsl{Condition} column corresponds to constraints that are captured
	either by how the \textsf{Operator} is defined (typically, which \textsf{container}
	is involved), or by information captured by traceability \textsf{Link}s (typically,
	an element is referenced in a \viewtype). Sometimes, information coming from \textsf{MM},
	the \metamodel under evolution, may bring other conditions that can be statically
	computed (typically, which sub- or super-classes). 
	
	\item The \textsl{Suggestion} column details, using the actions of Figure~\ref{fig:Recommendation}, which \textsf{Recommendation}s we offer, and which elements in the \viewtype they are applied to.

    \item We divided the table into two parts where the first part lists the \textsf{Primitive} operators and the rest contains the \textsf{Complex} ones. To keep the table relatively less crowded, we do not indicate this in the table.
\end{itemize}



Among the primitive operations the creation of various entities are of minor severity as they do not influence the existing relation between the \metamodel and corresponding \viewtypes. For the creation of package, class, data type, and enumeration, we only notify the modeller about the addition of these entities. 
According to the \metamodeling formalism proposed by \cite{herrmannsdoerfer_extensive_2011}, attributes and references, and literals, have composition relation with resp. classes and enumerations. Therefore, in the event of the creation of these entities, we first identify the \viewtypes that reference the corresponding container (i.e., class or enumeration) and suggest the addition of the new entities for these \viewtypes.

The deletion of a package is possible iff it is empty and therefore, this operation can be safely ignored. Deleting class, feature, data type, and enumeration can have major consequence if these entities are referred from one or more related \viewtypes as the partial representation relation with the corresponding \metamodel no longer holds. Therefore, the suggestion is to remove these entities also from the \viewtypes.

The \textit{Make Class Abstract} and \textit{Drop Class Abstract} are about making an existing class abstract and vice versa. As these operations only changes the abstraction without modifying the list of features, they can be ignored in the context of \viewtype co-evolution. 

The deletion of an opposite reference removes access to the referenced entity from the referencing one. The corresponding suggestion is to remove the references also from the \viewtype. \textit{Merge Literal} removes a literal and replaces its occurrence with another one. Therefore, applying this operations triggers the suggestion to replace the deleted literal with an existing one in the \viewtype. \textit{Rename} and \textit{Change Package} operators generate suggestions to do the same (i.e., renaming and changing package location) on the related \viewtypes.

The \textit{Add Super Type} and \textit{Remove Super Type} operators adds and removes inherited features from an existing class. Accordingly, the corresponding suggestion suggests the addition or removal of inherited features wherever the child class is referenced in the \viewtype. Although the suggestion for the former is of minor severity, the removal of features can break the \viewtype and hence, is classified as major.

The \textit{Make Attribute Identified} and \textit{Drop Attribute Identifier} operators adds or removes a constraint that ensures the uniqueness of the attribute values. The \textit{Make Reference Composite} and \textit{Drop Reference Composite} adds or removes the containment restriction for an reference. Since, these are instance level constraints, they do not influence the \viewtype and therefore, can be ignored.

\HM{Discuss \textit{Make ref opposite and drop ref opposite}} \MA{I have some arguments to say that we could ignore these in a first attempt, because "opposite"s may always be computed, assuming you have a "decent" meta-metamodel API (as EMF/Ecore provides, among others).}\LC{I agree.}

The \textit{Move Property} operator triggers the suggestion to update the corresponding location in the \viewtype. Pushing a property down in the hierarchy removes the property from the super class and therefore, it needs to be removed from the \viewtype wherever it is referred using a reference of the super class. The \textit{Pull Up} operator can be applied iff the corresponding feature is present in all the child classes. Since the feature is still accessible via inheritance, this does not trigger any suggestion for the related \viewtypes.

Extracting super class does not influence the effective set of features and therefore, triggers a minor suggestion for replacing some occurrences of the child class reference with the parent. The \textit{Flatten Hierarchy} moves all the features from the parent to the child classes and deletes the parent class. Therefore, this triggers a major suggestion for replacing all the references of the removed super class with the appropriate child class reference. Since the effective features of the child classes remain the same before and after fattening, we offer no suggestion for the child classes. The \textit{Extract Class} operator groups a set of features into a new delegate class and replaces their occurrences with a reference to the delegate class. The \textit{Inline Class} operator is the exact opposite of \textit{Extract Class}. Both triggers a major suggestion of adapting the location of any related feature referenced in the \viewtype.
