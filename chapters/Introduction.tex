\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item short motivation for setting (view-based development)
    \item motivation for why we want to do this (\metamodel evolution, industry study paper)
    \item motivating example (in-house developed DNS, domain-specific \metamodel extension, BPMN4CPS)
    \item overview of approach and contributions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limitations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item we do not support \metamodel \metamodel co-evolution
    \item we do not support \metamodel model co-evolution
    \item we only support co-evolution from the \metamodel to the \viewtype (which is actually not a limitation, since conceptually one can still start at the \viewtype)
    \item we only support one \metamodel as the source of a \viewtype (multiple \metamodels can be integrated into one, so no severe limitation)
\end{itemize}
