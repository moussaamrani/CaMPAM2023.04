As indicated earlier, the evolution of \metamodels is a well-known phenomenon in the model-driven community. With such evolution, related artefacts must co-evolve to maintain conformance and proper functioning of related software systems, which is becoming increasingly complex and susceptible to frequent changes. Hebig et al.~\autocite{Hebig2017} performed a survey on 31 approaches supporting the co-evolution of \metamodels and their related models, which is known as meta-model model (MM-M) co-evolution. They divided the surveyed approaches into six groups: resolution strategy languages, resolution strategy generation, resolution strategy learning, constrained model search, and identify complex changes. The first group includes seven transform languages for specifying MM-M co-evolution strategies, while the second group contains approaches for the generation of such strategies. The researches included in the third group tries to automate the co-evolution using a set of predefined strategies. The forth group includes one paper by Anguel et al.~\autocite{6581482} that proposes a learning based approach to learn resolution strategies. In the fifth group consists of four approaches that apply a constrained-based search of valid model variants considering the original model and the new \metamodel. Finally, the sixth group of works focus on detecting complex \metamodel changes instead of strictly focusing on co-evolution.

Kessentini et al.~\autocite{Kessentini2022} suggested a semi-automated interactive approach
